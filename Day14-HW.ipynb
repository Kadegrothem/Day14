    "**Q1** Bias is everywhere in algorithms and must be prevented to get viable decisions. Some pluses of using algorithms to make discissions is that they will not let emotions affect their decisions. Their decisions are purely based off of data and can not be affected by a current mood. Another plus is that algorithms may spot patterns that a human could not see. This pattern recognition could help make a decision based off a different point of view. With all the good that algorithms bring their is lots of minuses. The first being that algorithms can inherit biasis from faulty data. These biasis could discriminate against certain people or groups which is unfair."

    "2. Data ethics is crucial for managing personal information that affects millions worldwide. Recent incidents show the importance of ethical practices in data handling. For instance, British Airways’ 2018 data breach exposed customers' data to hackers. Apple’s credit card algorithm faced backlash for gender bias in credit limits, and Facebook’s 2021 data breach revealed the private information of over 533 million users. These cases highlight the harm when organizations misuse data. Ethical data use is essential for personal protection. As technology like AI and machine learning evolve, ethical concerns grow. We have to ensure that these innovations benefit society and require ethical data collection. Regulations like GDPR and CCPA help some but not nearly enough, making it hard to fully protect privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I agree with the author’s perspective on the importance of data ethics. The examples provided illustrate how mishandling data can have serious consequences to society. These incidents show that we need ethical oversight and a commitment to data security to protect people’s privacy. \n",
    "The author talks about how much data is powerful and pervasive. While it does lead to advancements, the misuse of data could have many negative consequences. We must think ethically to ensure that data is used responsibly.\r\n"

    "\n",
    "2. Personal data is collected from every online interaction, purchase, and social engagement. This raised the author to ask the question, who owns our digital identity? Individuals have limited control over their data, while companies use it for profit. Although laws like the GDPR and CCPA offer some user protections, they do not fully help with the ownership and privacy. User privacy allows individuals to control who has access to their personal information. Companies sell data to third parties and use it for targeted advertising. It can be used to expose data breaches, leading risks for users. It is hard for people to trust the internet as they lose control over their information. From a companies’ perspective, data is crucial.Social media or search engines are free to users since they take people’s data, including targeted advertising. Without access to data resources, companies would struggle. Data has become very important for tech companies, causing many ethical and privacy dilemmas for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I agree with the author’s on the role of personal data as both being valuable to companies, and a privacy for the users. The author shows the reality that every online interaction contributes to a digital footprint that companies monetize. This causes data to act as a currency, raising concerns about ownership and privacy. We rely on the internet daily, yet we are exposed to risks like data breaches and targeted advertising."

AI is now very important in healthcare, banking, retail, and manufacturing, where it’s used in improving efficiency, reducing costs, and aiding research. However, AI has raised concerns about harming people in biases in systems that determine health, employment, and criminal justice. The AI market has seen much growth and is projected to reach $110 billion by 2024. Industries like retail, banking, and government invest in AI since it may reshape entire industries over the next decade.\n",
